# Data Enrichment Project
Kevin Barnett

*Business Problem: What charateristics of a movie (i.e genre, rating) make it more successful than others?*

## Data Sources

## Data Filtering
The IMDB data was filtered for a specific subset of data, requested by the stakeholder.


## API Calls
API calls were made from The Movie Database (TMDB) to extract movie revenue and profit data from 2001-2022. The data was combined into one single dataframe.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Prior to EDA being performed the data was cleaned.

**Question 1: How many movies had at least some valid financial information (values > 0 for budget OR revenue)?**

**Question 2: How many movies are there in each of the certification categories (G/PG/PG-13/R)?**

**Question 3: What is the average revenue per certification category?**

**Question 4: What is the average revenue per certification category?**

## MySQL Database

## Hypothesis Testing
